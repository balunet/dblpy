This library provide a high-level framework which uses the DBLP XML Requests
API. You can search the publications of a given author, filter these
publications when searching for a concrete paper, or even get the bibtex
citation.  

Due to the limitations of their API, we have to perform a first query to search
the author key, then another query for each author found (it may return more
than one author), and finally two queries for every publication found for each
author. Therefore, the fact of making all this queries considerably slow down
the speed of the library. This effect increases with the number of publications
of the considered authors.
